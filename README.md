# go-learning

A learning repository where I study **Go**: notes, exercises, and small mini-projects.

Most of the progress and tasks here come from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend-python-golang)

## Projects

- **pokedexcli** - Interactive command-line Pokedex with PokeAPI integration
- **gator** - RSS feed aggregator CLI with PostgreSQL backend
